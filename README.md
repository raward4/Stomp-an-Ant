SEI Course Unit 1 Project - Browser-based Game

History:

User Experience: The idea is to create a fun game where you "stomp ants" using quick response time and mouse manipulation. Your score reflects your ability level! The hope is to allow users to upload any image they wish onto this page and the game allows the user to "whack!" any image they wish. The app is targeted towards users using phones or computers during their workday and allows individuals to take quick breaks whacking their...let's say ...'boss' in the face! It is stress relieving and fun!
