## History:
This game is based on the arcade classic 'Whac-a-mole'. Originally named "Mole Buster" in Japan during the late '70s, this game gained popularity at carinvals in the West by 1980. Why moles? Idk. 

## How to play:
Stop the ants from ruining your picnic by...
1. Clicking the 'start' button to begin the timer. 
2. Whacking as many ants as you can before the timer ends by clicking on the image before it disappears.
3. Playing again - try and beat your score!

## User Experience: 
The idea is to create a fun game where you "stomp ants" using quick response time and mouse manipulation. Your score reflects your ability level! The hope is to allow users to upload any image they wish onto this page and the game allows the user to "whack!" any image they wish. The game is targeted towards users with phones or laptops who are looking to healthily relieve stress during their regular day with a fun game.
