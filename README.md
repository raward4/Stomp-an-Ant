# Unit-1-Bowser-based-Game
SEI Course Unit 1 Project - Browser-based Game

Originally named "Mole Buster" and beginning in Japan in the late '70s, this game gained popularity at carinvals in the West by 1980. The game is now more commonly referred to as "Whac-a-mole". Why moles? Idk. 

1. Click "begin game" to start the timer. 
2. Whack as many ants as you can before the timer ends.
3. Play again and try and beat your score!

Improvements: upload any image, say of your boss for example, and whack that instead of ants!
